Some definitions
Classes = blueprints 
With these classes you can group together certain variables. It helps break up the work into sections making things organized and easier 
to read.  

Semicolons are used to end a statement unless you are using a curvy brace. 
Curvy brace are always put in the beginning of the code and at the end when you are done with the class. You will also finish up in an 
even amount of braces.

Dots in code help separate things like objects/commands. In every command there will be a certain amount of elements. Say you use the 
command Transform you will then have to choose between 3 actions Position, Scale or Rotation.  Once you chose your action/element you will
then choose X, Y, or Z, all this is needed to make the whole line of code work. Think of it like an address without the State on the card,
you cannot send out the card. 

Indenting your code isnâ€™t necessary but it makes the code easier to read if you are working in a group. 
Comments can be used in the code without interfering with anything, there are two different ways to add a comment. The Frist is using  // 
by putting these two slashes in the beginning of your line and then writing whatever note you want to leave behind. The second way is 
using   /* */  with this one you will start by adding /*  in the beginning of you note  and finally ending it off with */
Example:  /* this gives the sphere 1.5 speed of rotation 
           * line 4 can randomize the speed 
          */   
Also with the second method it can help disable code, you just have to add it before you statement and after your curvy brace. This a
good way to let you see your unfinished code, while working on other sections. This also help not interrupt Unity when it reads your code.
